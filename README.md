This repo contains projects that so small that the whole code can be put in a single file. \
Projects that make sense:
- alarm.html: An alarm with 2 songs so you can put 1 light song, 1 loud song; include a brightness adjustment to simulate sunrise.
- colorful-keys.html: change screen color on every keypress.
- cool-clock.html: A weird clock but really beautiful for decoration
- reaction-training.html: Train your reaction like pilots or F1 drivers do. In real life, they will drop the ball, but here, the light will change.
- snake.html: A weird snae game where the snake can teleport to the food with space button.
